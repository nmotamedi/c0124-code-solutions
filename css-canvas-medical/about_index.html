              So, what do you say? We got a basket full of father-son fun here.
              What's Kama Sutra oil? Maybe it's not for us. Oh please. They
              didn't sneak into this country to be your friends. I need a fake
              passport, preferably to Franceâ€¦I like the way they think.

              No! These are just strippers! Look how hot they are! I've been in
              the film business for a while but I just cant seem to get one in
              the can. Did Ted make an appointment? No. Well then Ted can GET
              THE HELL OUT OF THIS OFFICE! YOU GET THE HELL OUT!

            Everyone's laughing, and riding, and cornholing except Buster. I
            don't want no part of yo' tight-ass country club, ya freak bitch!
            So, what do you say? We got a basket full of father-son fun here.
            What's Kama Sutra oil? Maybe it's not for us. If this tableau I
            recreate, perhaps I can re-snare my mate. No, she's in it. She's a
            contestant. It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it
            is.

            You stay on top of her, Buddy. Don't be afraid to ride her. Hard.
            Excuse me, do these effectively hide my thunder? Well excuse me,
            Judge Reinhold. Whenever she'd change clothes, she'd make me wait on
            the balcony until zip-up, and yet anything goes at bath time. Dad
            would stage elaborate situations using a one-armed man to teach us
            lessons. Let's see some bananas and nuts! Today I learned this is a
            real place, tho more lush than the OC.
